# Order Stock Management System

# I. Project Overview
  This system consists of two main modules: the Order Management System (OMS) and the Inventory Management System (IMS). The Order Management System (OMS) handles customer orders,
order tracking, and fulfillment. It ensures accurate and efficient processing of customer requests and facilitates real-time order status updates to enhance customer satisfaction.
The Inventory Management System (IMS) manages stock levels, product categorization, and inventory tracking. It monitors stock availability to prevent overstocking or understocking 
and provides detailed insights into inventory trends for better decision-making.

# II. Application of Phython Concepts and Libraries

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The tkinter library was employed to create an intuitive interface, including buttons, labels, text entries, and tables.

**Database Connectivity:** The mysql.connector library facilitates connections to a MySQL database, allowing CRUD operations on inventory and user authentication.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes and methods were used to organize code for components like LoginApp, InventoryApp, and ManageOrderApp, enhancing modularity and reusability.

**Error Handling:** Try-except blocks were implemented for managing database errors and invalid user inputs gracefully.

**Dynamic Data Handling:** Widgets like Treeview display inventory data dynamically, while forms and buttons allow updates in real time.

# III. Chosen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
    
This project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production by:

**Optimizing Inventory Management:** The system prevents overstocking and understocking by maintaining accurate records of stock levels, reducing food waste.

**Promoting Efficiency**: Automation of order and inventory processes improves resource usage, saving time and minimizing errors.

**Real-Time Data:** Decision-making is enhanced with up-to-date inventory and sales data, promoting sustainability in operations.
